"Now we have before us a solution that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon without resorting to war." ‚ÄîPresident Obama 
"President Kennedy warned Americans not to see conflict as inevitable. It is time to apply such wisdom.‚Äù ‚ÄîPresident Obama 
"I have repeatedly challenged anyone opposed to this deal to put forward a better, plausible alternative." ‚ÄîPresident Obama

"What made our new approach more effective was our ability to draw upon new U.N. Security Council resolutions." ‚ÄîPresident Obama 
‚ÄúIt was our very willingness to negotiate that helped America rally the world to our cause.‚Äù ‚ÄîPresident Obama 
"I have also made clear my preference for a peaceful diplomatic resolution of the issue." ‚ÄîPresident Obama
